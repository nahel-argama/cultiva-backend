# Laravel Docker Setup

Personal Docker setup for Laravel development (and to help my bad memory).

# Important
  - This setup is for **Postrgresql** databases and **don't have** a **redis** and laravel **queue** container
  - If you want to use this you will need implement them in the compose file and php dockerfile

## Create Laravel project:
```bash
docker compose exec php bash
```
Inside php container
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel .
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

Endpoints:
- Laravel: http://localhost:8080
- pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050

## Connect to the database (from host)
Port 5432 is exposed, so any Postgres client (psql, DBeaver, TablePlus...) can connect directly:
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5432`
- User: `root`
- Password: `root`
- Database: `app`

```bash
psql -h localhost -U root -d app
```
